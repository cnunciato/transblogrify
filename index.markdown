We went on a trip in January to check out the city and make sure it was a place we wanted to move. And even in the winter it was beautiful and we found lots of fun things to do and hung out with a lot of cool people. We felt at home, as we had in London, and that was the feeling we were looking for.

### [May 2, 2013](musings/2013/05/may-2-2013.html)

One of the best things about a recent sewing class I took was discovering new tools! Architecture tracing paper is amazing for tracing patterns. I cant believe I wasted years using brown paper and carbon paper. Also a small rotory cutter! I have a big one that is only good for straight lines. This one can cut around curves. Love it!  
I used these new tools to cut out some pants for my middle child who never seems to have enough clean pants. I used my husbands old pants that were already in the give away pile. It was fun to up-cycle. I have never really done that before. So excited for all the possibilities.

### [Earring frame ](musings/2013/01/earring-frame.html)

This is one of those Pinterest ideas. I took a frame, glued pretty paper to the cardboard that comes in the frame, wrapped ribbon around and stapled to secure. I put the glass piece behind the cardboard. And now I have a cute earring hanger. It is much better than the pile they were in in my jewelry box. Easy peasy.

### [Coffee cozy](musings/2012/12/coffee-cozy.html)

This Chemex coffee carafe is much loved around here. It is a simple way to make coffee. But the coffee gets cold really fast. Yesterday I finally made a little cozy for it. I used a red dish towel and some print fabric that I have had around a long time. I cut both in a big circle. Zig zagged together. Added a band at the top for elastic. And now our coffee will stay warm a little bit longer.

### [A little something for me](musings/2012/07/a-little-something-for-me.html)

I don't often sew things for myself. Other than things for around the house. I am not confident in sewing clothes. But a half apron seemed pretty easy. This is from Simplicity 2272.  
I used what was left of the kitcheny fabrics I had left in my stash and managed to keep the kids at bay long enough to get it finished. It is amazing what you can do in a morning when you just do it.  
I may need to wait a few more weeks til it fits me properly.

### [Quick change trousers ](musings/2012/07/quick-change-trousers.html)

These are for baby #3 who should be arriving soon. I have made several of these and just love them. I am sure I will be making them again.

### [Three across](musings/2012/06/three-across.html)

One of my major goals this summer was to figure out how to get three car seats in the back of our Subaru. I found a lot of people use the [Radian RXT](http://www.radianrxt.com/) which advertises that you can fit three across. And it worked! I just got the second Raidan I wanted to buy in the mail. So my husband pulled out all the seats and vacuumed out the all the muffin and granola bar pieces. 

I also decided to make a cover for the seat so that the crumbs and milk spills wouldn't get into the cushion or the creases of the seat. I found a remnant of outdoor canvas at JoAnns. It was just under a yard and 60" wide so it was a perfect piece. I turned under the raw edges and marked where the buckles and latch pieces were in the car with a pencil. Then used a rotery cutter to slice open the marks. Used some bias tape and covered those raw edges. Done! It worked out great. I am so excited. 

[ ![Image](.a/6a00e5509b730c88330163065e8b40970d-800wi.jpg "Image") ](.a/6a00e5509b730c88330163065e8b40970d.jpg)

This picture was taken with my husbands new wide angle lens for his iPhone. He is very excited about it. 

I used a light blue bias tape (because I had it) and so that it would show up well against the black when I am searching for the opening for the buckles. For a quick and dirty piece of work it turned out really well. 

[ ![Image 1](.a/6a00e5509b730c88330163065e8fc3970d-800wi.jpg "Image 1") ](.a/6a00e5509b730c88330163065e8fc3970d.jpg)

Here is another wide angle picture from of my husband. This is all the carseats (minus the snap in part of the infant seat). 

The other awesome thing is that we can use the Britax baby seat we already had. I thought I was going to have to buy a narrower baby seat to fit in there. Yay! More money saved. So we got to keep our car and keep one of the seats we had. And hopefully we won't have to buy the carseat adapter for our Britax stroller now. Even more money saved!!!

The only bummer is that we had to turn Sam around sooner than we would have liked but so it goes. The rear-facing position of the Radian pushed the front seats up too far. 

This was such a big project for me to finish my brain has a huge void in it now. I am sure I will find another project to fill it with soon.

### [Play mat for baby niece](musings/2012/05/play-mat-for-baby-niece.html)

Directions came from this post. http://www.purlbee.com/cheerful-quilted-playmat/  
This was my first time at hand quilting. And my fingers are sore but I like the way it turned out.

### [Good morning blog readers](musings/2011/11/good-morning-blog-readers.html)

I have so many things I want to share I need to get crackin'

Here are some pictures from a gift I made recently for my friend in Australia. She asked for an apron for her birthday. I didn't get any pictures of her apron but I did get one of the mini one I made for her daughter. 

[ ![IMG_4731](.a/6a00e5509b730c8833015436c46202970c-800wi.jpg "IMG_4731") ](.a/6a00e5509b730c8833015436c46202970c.jpg)

[ ![IMG_4730](.a/6a00e5509b730c88330162fc46358d970d-800wi.jpg "IMG_4730") ](.a/6a00e5509b730c88330162fc46358d970d.jpg)

And these are the pot holders for mom. An oven mitt and some flat pot holders.

I used Butterick 5474 for the apron. And McCalls's 5903 for the pot holders. 

The fabric I bought at one of my favorite quilt shops the Quilting Loft in Ballard. I used my bias tape tool to make my bias tape. I love using that thing. 

I have another apron and accessories in the works. Pictures of that soon. But I have to get it to the birthday girl first.

### [Third Place finds](musings/2011/09/third-place-finds.html)

Last night was my night to go out of the house for a while by myself. Chris and I are each trying to take a night off as our own. Last night I decided to go to Third Place Books. A favorite place of ours. I love the wood floors and shelves, and the selection they have. And I love the used books put amongst the new books. (Even better is when used books are 40% off.) 

Chris was really sweet and gave me some bonus spending money since I didn't have any left. (We also do spending money.)

I had a really good time wandering the shelves looking at different genres. I wasn't sure what mood I was in at first so I picked up quite a few titles before settling on these five books. 

[ ![IMG_4480](.a/6a00e5509b730c8833014e8b3d0654970d-800wi.jpg "IMG_4480") ](.a/6a00e5509b730c8833014e8b3d0654970d.jpg)  
    

I have read several Dresden Files books by Jim Butcher and watched the TV show. I like his dry humor. This book in the first in another series of his. 

_Your Two Year Old _is a title recommended to my by one of my MOPs friends. This unfortunately was not used so I used half of my spending money on this one. I am hoping it gives me a little insight into the two year old brain. And since it is so thin it is less daunting then my other parenting and discipline books that go unopened. 

As a fantasy/funny/England lover, Terry Pratchett is one of those authors that I feel like I should read but I don't know how to approach. There are so many books of his I didn't know where to begin. Another MOPs friend of mine recommended his young adult series starting with _The Wee Free Men._ I started this one last night and within the first few pages I was loving it. The woman at the register told me these were great and that I must read all four. She was also jealous of the editions that I found. They have different art than the other paperbacks. They are used and may be UK prints. (Score!)

And then there is _Emma_. Once I got into the mental state of being across the pond I wanted to read some classic literature. I looked at _Pride and Predujice_ but I really like _Emma_ also. I don't remember if I have other copies of this but I like the 80s looking hardback (again a used find). I wanted to get _Jane Eyre_ (which I have not read since high school?) also but couldn't find a copy that I really liked. The Friends of the Library sale is coming up soon so I will look for a nice hardback there. 

This postcard I found is the same print as a poster I use to hang in my apartment. It reminded me of a little piece of myself that was nice to see again. 

[ ![IMG_4485](.a/6a00e5509b730c88330154351ca2e1970c-800wi.jpg "IMG_4485") ](.a/6a00e5509b730c88330154351ca2e1970c.jpg)  
    

I am looking forward to escaping with my new books.

### [Sunday](musings/2011/08/sunday.html)

[ ![IMG_4459](.a/6a00e5509b730c8833015434ea7dd9970c-800wi.jpg "IMG_4459") ](.a/6a00e5509b730c8833015434ea7dd9970c.jpg)

At church today I saw my childhood piano teacher's son! He was singing a solo. So weird. He and I are both from Cincinnati, a long way from Seattle. He was older and cooler than me so I didn't say hi. Anyway. 

After church we went to the Ballard farmer's market where we had lunch; some pizza for Chris and Oliver and a vegan tamali and veggies for me, really good despite the lack of cheese. We bought some fruit and some beets and okra and potatoes and onion and mini doughnuts and a balloon animal. I think we need to go every Sunday. 

The balloon animal broke on the way to the car. I spread some apricot on homemade teething toast for Sam. He loved it. The beets have these amazing greens on them I have to make something with them. Chris is baking the okra right now. The potatoes and onion I cut up and put into the crock pot with a whole chicken and some corn on the cob. It has been six hours and is almost ready to eat. This is my first whole chicken in a crock pot experience. I am hoping it goes well. I am not a crock pot user. Mainly because I forget to get it started early enough and I don't know what to cook in it. 

A good Sunday.
